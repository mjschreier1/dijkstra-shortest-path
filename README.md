## Shortest Path

I was intrigued while doing some research on Dijkstra's algorithm and decided to try an implementation of my own. The program works through a given rectangular maze, evaluating the shortest path from a given origin point to a given destination point. Note that the given maze must be in the form of a two-dimensional array with 1s representing open paths and 0s representing walls. The output will print the maze with the shortest path being replaced with 2s, as well as a count of steps required to complete the maze.
